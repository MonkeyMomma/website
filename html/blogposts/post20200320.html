          <p>Hey y’all, Monkey Momma here. Today’s post is gonna be tough for some to read, but it’s an important topic to discuss. One of my goals with this blog/vlog enterprise is to raise awareness of mental health issues and help end the stigma of mental health issues, especially in industries where people are “supposed” to be emotionless and in-humanely strong.  So, hold onto your butts, because today we’re gonna talk about suicide.</p>

		  <blockquote class="blockquote">In no way is anything here intended to be medical or mental health professional advice, and my tricks I discuss may or may not work for any particular individual. This is just my personal experience that I hope might help at least one person out there. </blockquote>

      <p>As most people who actually know me know, I spent most of my adolescence and adulthood in various aspects of emergency services. I have done search and rescue, been in emergency medicine from First Responder to Paramedic, was a volunteer firefighter, wildland firefighter, and an emergency medical dispatcher. In addition to this, I am a survivor of child abuse, both physical and emotional.  I have spent a good deal of my life putting my mind and body in danger to help others, most of the time with little to no recognition and often at companies that care nothing for their employees.</p>

      <p>Since I was very young, I have dealt with an overwhelming feeling of darkness in my mind. <em>It feels like shadowy arms and hands are holding me back from being fully emotionally present in many situations.</em>  Sometimes, this was a help. I could shut down when I was being hit by the “man” who was supposed to be my protector for whatever he perceived was my current misdeed. I could shut down when I was doing CPR and starting IV’s on a young girl who was lacerated every two inches up her body from being sucked under a speed boat in the lake.  Not to say those incidents didn’t affect me later, but I got through the incident by shutting down emotionally.  </p>

		  <p><b>But the darkness also keeps me from enjoying life.</b>  Things that should be happy and bright are shadowed by this feeling of being pulled into darkness. When I was about 15-16 years old, I was first formally diagnosed with depression.  Through a lifetime of trying to save others and be everything I feel others expect of me as a daughter, sister, aunt, mom, paramedic, firefighter, dispatcher, mom and wife, I struggled with depression and many times, suicidal thoughts. For many people with severe depression, there is a voice, or voices, in your head that keep telling you you are worthless, a waste of space, and that the world would be better off without you. Sometimes, these voices go the next step and even tell you to try to take your life. I still struggle with this, and in recent months, it has gotten even worse.</p>

      <p>I am writing this post though, to remind myself and others in similar situations that <strong> this is not the option to take.</strong> That voice is wrong, and you must find ways to fight and ignore it. I know it’s hard. I can sit in the back of an ambulance and talk another depressed person through these thoughts, but I still find it hard to stop them for myself. If you can’t fight them alone, seek help from a friend, a doctor, someone. Call 911 and talk to a dispatcher until fire and EMS arrives if you must. But, don’t take that step and try to end your life. As cliché as it sounds, it is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. </p>

			<h2 class="section-heading">What can you do?</h2>

      <p>What helps me to not take that step is to remember what suicide would do to those I leave behind.  In fact, I have a list of reasons, people actually, that would be affected if I died. My daughter, my husband, my nieces and nephews, my daughter’s two friends who are so close to me that they are practically my nephews… I remind myself of them, just listing their names, when I get too far into the darkness to see any other options. </p>

		  <p><em>I know the feeling of being affected by another’s suicide</em>, and I remind myself I don’t want anyone I love to feel like that. During the ambulance phase of my EMS career, I had many good partners, but there were three guys who hold very special spots in my heart. One, I married. Another is like an older brother to me. The third was my “EMS little Brother”. We started out with me as his FTO and became partners in the next shift bid. We worked together well and got along great. He really was like a little brother. After the company closed, he moved across the country, but we remained Facebook friends.  As with many things in life, distance faded our friendship. However, we still chatted occasionally over Facebook, and did the typical birthday posts and stuff. We chatted over a post shortly before Thanksgiving one year and didn’t get a chance to talk for a while after that. I thought it was mostly the holidays and Facebook’s crazy algorithms keeping me from seeing his posts and didn’t think much of it.  When I went to his page on his birthday shortly after the new year, I found out he had hung himself. I knew he was struggling, but <em> I didn’t think he’d ever take it that far.</em></p>

          <p>I mean, this was a guy who I had sat in an ambulance with and discussed the negative effects of suicide after 5150 calls. We had been angry together at patients who had tried and failed, leaving their families to care for them in vegetative states for decades. We had been sad together for the kids who found their parent dead. And, I found out not only did he hang himself; his stepson was the one to find him. I was, at the same time, sad at losing my friend, and angry that he would do that to his son and family. And us, his friends and EMS family. That feeling, of not being sure how to move on without a friend, of being mad and sad at the same time… well, <strong>it sucks</strong>.  Especially when you get the news right before going in to work as a dispatcher and one of your first calls of the shift is trying to talk a stranger into putting pressure on her bleeding wrists while you and your unit are trying to find her because she doesn’t know exactly where she is around the hospital she just left because they couldn’t help her. </p>

			<blockquote class="blockquote">I can’t let someone I love feel like that. </blockquote>

			<h2 class="section-heading">Suicide is a true public health crisis.</h2>

            <p>The statistics for suicide are frightening. In 2017, 45,390 American Adults took their own lives . That’s an average of over 120 people a day. Of that number, 6,139 were Veterans of the Armed Forces. 140 of these were law enforcement officers , 103 were firefighters , numbers higher than the numbers of line of duty deaths for the same careers that year. I can’t find 2017 numbers for emergency medicine, however the average suicide rate for EMS providers is 64.9 per 100,000 , which is over five times the rate in the general populace. Think about those numbers a bit. Think about how many people had to wake up one day and realize they would never see the person they cared about again. </p>

			<p><em>Suicide is not the way to solve the pain and problems in your life.</em> It just transfers those problems to others. Everyone from the person who finds your body, the paramedic, firefighters, and cops that respond to that person’s call for help, the Coroner, your friends, your family, your neighbors… they are all affected.  You may think no one cares, but someone, even if it’s just the dispatcher who takes the call from the person who finds your body, will care. If you feel like you have no choice, reach out. I am going to include a list of resources on this post. These are no where near all the resources available. The easiest resource to access is the emergency system. Call 9-1-1, or your local emergency services number for your area.  <strong>Help will be on the way.</strong></p>

			<h2 class="section-heading">But, I can't look weak in front of the crew...</h2>

      <p>Even if you are in public safety, don’t let a stigma of having to be strong or potential embarrassment keep you from calling.  Think about it this way, would you rather transport a coworker to a hospital for psychiatric treatment, or transport them to the trauma center because they tried to kill themselves, or worse, sit with their body, waiting for the Coroner to arrive and take it away, with their family crying and leaning on you for support? I’d wager you’d rather transport them for psychiatric help than the alternative. Don’t make your coworkers have to sit with your body. Seek help before it’s too late. There is always another option. <strong>ALWAYS.</strong><p/>

       <p>On the other hand, those who care about people with depression have a role to play in suicide prevention, too.  Remember, you may not realize someone you know has suicidal thoughts. With the stigmas surrounding mental health in our society, people around you may be suffering severe depression or other mental health issues without you even knowing. They may even appear to be regular, happy people. Often, with depression, we become really good at acting like we are fine. This is why it is so important to try to be kind to everyone.  I am not advocating being a doormat, or giving away more than you can, or anything like that. I simply mean, don’t be a jerk. Don’t cut people off, <em>use your turn signal</em>, hold a door for someone whose hands are full. Smile at people, say hi.</p>

			<h2 class="section-heading">Back to basics</h2>

	     <p>Basically, remember how we were taught to treat others back in kindergarten? Do that. If you are generally kind to others, it will brighten their days a little. For someone with severe depression who may be contemplating ending their life, just that little bit of kindness may be enough to save them. Yeah, we all have bad days, I do myself, but if we all strive to be kinder, it could go a long way to helping people with depression and suicidal ideations. It can also help a lot of other aspects of our society that aren’t the topic of this post. </p>

       <p>This blog post is now super long, so I want to wrap it up with the main point I want to make.<em> <strong> There is always a better option than suicide.</strong></em> If you find yourself contemplating it, think about those who will be affected. You won’t be ending any of your pain, you will just transfer it to someone else. Everyone should try to be kinder to help brighten the world. I am not saying it’s easy, because I know firsthand it is not. Fighting suicidal thoughts is one of the hardest things in the world to do. </p>
